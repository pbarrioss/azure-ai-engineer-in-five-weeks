## Overview 📋

In **Week 4**, we focus on **building and scaling** your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to **enterprise production levels**. By now, you should already be familiar with:

- A **vector database** (e.g., Azure AI Search,Cosmos DB).
- Integrating **GPT-4** (or GPT-3.5/GPT-4o).
- A basic **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** pipeline from prior weeks.

### Why Emphasize Scalability, Cost, and Reliability?

As your system grows—especially when handling higher traffic loads and more complex workloads—the **performance, cost-efficiency, and reliability** of your RAG solution become critical. This week, you will learn to:

1. **Optimize** your AI solutions for higher throughput and lower latency.
2. Integrate **caching** and advanced **monitoring** techniques to save costs and maintain consistent performance.
3. **Design modular components** so your solution can easily adapt to new use cases and production environments.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of **Week 4**, you will be able to:

1. **Scale** your RAG pipeline with multi-region deployments and load balancing for high availability.
2. **Incorporate Semantic Caching** to reduce redundant API calls and improve response times.
3. **Develop an Interactive UI** using frameworks like Streamlit to let users “chat with their data.”
4. **Implement Monitoring and Logging** via tools like Azure Application Insights to ensure reliability and fast troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites 📚

Before diving into **Week 4**:

- You should have **completed Week 3**, where you focused on basic **evaluation** and **monitoring** of your GenAI system.
- Have access to a **Cloud Environment** (Azure, AWS, or GCP) that can host your vector database and LLM integrations.
- Familiarity with **logging** and **telemetry** is helpful (we will expand on these concepts in this lab).

### Required Readings & Notebooks

1. **Azure Documentation**:  
- [Key Technical Challenges While Transitioning GenAI Applications to Production](https://pabloaicorner.hashnode.dev/key-technical-challenges-while-transitioning-genai-applications-to-production)
- [Error 429 Explained: Navigating Azure OpenAI API Rate Limits](https://pabloaicorner.hashnode.dev/error-429-explained-navigating-azure-openai-api-rate-limits)

- **Why Multi-Region and Load Balancing?**
    - Ensuring optimal performance and reliability is critical for enterprise AI applications. Load balancing and multi-region deployments improve throughput, ensure redundancy, and support global availability.
- **Implementation Focus:**
    - Use load-balancing tools, such as Azure API Management (APIM), to distribute API requests across multiple regions.
    - Deploy services in multiple regions to provide redundancy and minimize downtime.
    - Monitor usage and scale resources proactively to meet demand.

> **Note:** We won't implement `AI Gateaway` in the lab, but you can refer to the following articles for more information and to push forward with your Understanding why we need this layer enterprise level:

2. **Streamlit Docs**:  
   - [Getting Started with Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started)  
   Quickstart for building interactive web interfaces with Python.

3. **Application Insights**:  
   - [Azure Monitor Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)  
   Describes how to set up logging, collect telemetry data, and perform live monitoring.

## In-Class Activities 🛠️

During our session, we will focus on **hands-on** exercises that illustrate **scalability, caching, and observability**:

### 1. Understand the Importance of Multi-Region Load Balancing
- **Real-World Example**: We’ll explore how global enterprises handle rolling updates, large volumes of requests, and failover scenarios without downtime.

### 2. Semantic Caching with Cosmos DB (MongoDB Core)
- **Hands-On**: Implement a caching layer to reduce repeated queries to the LLM and speed up retrieval.  
- **Demo**: Observe how caching drastically reduces latency and cost by limiting outbound calls to your LLM or vector database.

### 3. Streamlit Integration
- **Interactive UI**: Build a small demo app that allows users to query or “chat” with your RAG-based system.  
- **Deploy**: Optionally, host it on a cloud service (Streamlit Cloud, Azure Web App, etc.) to showcase an interactive front end.

### 4. Traceability and Logging
- **Application Insights**: Instrument your code to capture logs, telemetry, and performance metrics in real time.  
- **Hands-On**: Generate a set of test queries, watch them flow through the system, and learn how to trace each interaction from the UI to your backend.
